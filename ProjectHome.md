SIPek is a small open source project that is intended to share common VoIP software design concepts and practices. It'd also like to become a simple and easy-to-use SIP phone with many useful features.

SIPek's user interface is built with **Menu Designer** (http://code.google.com/p/menudesigner) framework which is suitable for embedded devices. The telephony part is powered by great SIP stack engine **PJSIP** (http://www.pjsip.org).

The SIPek's simple software design enables efficient development, easy upgrading and user menus customizations.

**About**

SIPek intentionally simulates embedded VoIP phone user experience. That's because of its embedded roots...
A new SIPek based project with .Net GUI is started. See http://code.google.com/p/sipek2/!

SIPek and Menu Designer are created by
